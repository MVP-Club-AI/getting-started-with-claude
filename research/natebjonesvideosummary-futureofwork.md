● This is a rich video. Here are the core ideas I'd build specific trainings around, organized by theme:

  ---
  1. The Five Levels of Vibe Coding (2:37 - 5:34)

  Training: "Know Your Level"
  - Self-assessment: where are you actually operating vs. where you think you are?
  - Practical exercises for each level transition (especially 2→3 and 3→4)
  - The key insight at 3:45 — 90% of developers who call themselves "AI native" are stuck at level 2

  ---
  2. Specification Writing as the New Core Skill (4:39 - 5:13, 21:26 - 22:28)

  Training: "Writing Specs That Machines Can Build From"
  - This is called out repeatedly as the bottleneck. At 22:00: "If what you described was ambiguous, you're going to get       
  software that fills in the gaps with software guesses, not customer-centric guesses."
  - Exercises: take a feature idea → write a spec → feed it to an agent → evaluate the gap between intent and output → iterate 
  on the spec
  - This is probably your highest-value training

  ---
  3. Scenarios vs. Tests (8:40 - 10:14)

  Training: "Designing Holdout Evaluations for AI-Generated Code"
  - The distinction between tests (inside the codebase, gameable) and scenarios (external behavioral specs, holdout sets)      
  - Directly maps to ML concepts like overfitting prevention
  - Practical: how to design scenario suites for your own projects

  ---
  4. The J-Curve of AI Adoption (15:25 - 16:13)

  Training: "Surviving the Productivity Dip"
  - The METR study finding (19% slower, 14:23) is the hook
  - Why bolting AI onto existing workflows makes you slower
  - The critical reframe at 15:49: "You're running a new engine on old transmission"
  - Paired with the workflow redesign content at 17:02-17:46

  ---
  5. Workflow Redesign, Not Tool Adoption (16:13 - 17:46)

  Training: "Redesigning Your Development Workflow Around AI"
  - End-to-end process transformation: specs, review processes, CI/CD, role expectations
  - The quote at 16:43 is the hook: "Copilot makes writing code cheaper but owning it more expensive"
  - Concrete exercises: map your current workflow → identify friction points → redesign for AI-generated code at volume        

  ---
  6. Organizational Structure Transformation (18:24 - 20:12)

  Training: "From Coordination to Articulation" (for managers/leads)
  - Every existing ceremony (standups, sprints, code review, QA) was designed for human limitations
  - At 21:03: skills shifting "from coordination to articulation"
  - Exercise: audit your team's processes — which ones exist because humans write code? What replaces them?

  ---
  7. The Brownfield Reality (22:28 - 26:08)

  Training: "Bringing AI to Legacy Systems"
  - This is where most companies actually live
  - The four-step migration path at 25:04 is a ready-made curriculum outline:
    a. Use AI at level 2-3 for current work
    b. Use AI to document what your system actually does
    c. Redesign CI/CD for AI-generated code at volume
    d. Shift new development to level 4-5 while maintaining legacy in parallel
  - The hardest part: reverse-engineering institutional knowledge into specs

  ---
  8. The Talent Reckoning / Career Development (26:47 - 32:00)

  Training: "The New Career Ladder" (two tracks: juniors and managers)
  - Junior track: systems thinking, generalist skills, AI-native workflows, the "medical residency" model (30:43)
  - Manager track: how to coach engineers toward spec-writing and judgment skills
  - The stat at 28:55: "adequate is no longer a viable career position... adequate is what the models do"

  ---
  9. Digital Twin / Simulated Environment Design (10:14 - 11:01)

  Training: "Building Simulated Environments for Autonomous Development"
  - StrongDM's behavioral clones of external services
  - How to create sandboxed integration testing without touching production
  - More advanced/niche but critical for anyone actually pushing toward level 4-5

  ---
  My Recommended Priority Order

  1. Spec Writing — the single highest-leverage skill gap
  2. Workflow Redesign — addresses the J-curve directly
  3. Know Your Level — self-awareness foundation for everything else
  4. Scenarios vs. Tests — practical and immediately applicable
  5. Brownfield Migration Path — where most orgs actually need to start
  6. Career/Talent — important but more strategic than tactical

  Want me to flesh out a curriculum structure for any of these?
