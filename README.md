## How prompt-alongs work

These aren't articles to read. They're **procedural walkthroughs** you do side by side with Claude.

**Setup:** Open two windows next to each other:

1. **Left** — Claude Code (your terminal) or Claude Cowork (desktop app)
2. **Right** — The prompt-along in your browser

**Flow:** Each tutorial walks you step by step. When you hit a prompt block, copy it, paste it into Claude, and follow along with the results. You're building something real as you go — not watching a demo.

No coding experience required for the first tier. By the end, you're engineering automated pipelines.
